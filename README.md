Motto: "_better code in gawk_"

Auk is a pre-processor to awk (actually, Gnu Awk version 4.0+) that supports:

+ Structures
+ Multi-line comments

Auk also supports a set of conventions that make it easier to build and document Awk code:

+ Auto-generate markdown from source code.
+ Auto-create web sites displaying the code.
+ Test suites, regression suites, demo stuires.
+ Command line flags (not POSIX compiaant, but similar and simpler).

For example, this repo contains numerous data mining tools, written in Auk.
